# Cash Casino but better

<h2>Intro</h2>
This was a project as my IT exam in 5 hours total.

<h2>Tech used</h2>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
<li>Survey https://github.com/Exahilosys/survey</li>

<h2>How to install it yourself</h2>

1. First you need to click the <>code button and choose "Download ZIP".
2. Then you can create a folder with a name of your choosing, and extract the ZIP file's content to that folder.
3. I have .gitignored a json file that holds my firebase key. Because of this, you need your own key.
4. To do that, you visit https://console.firebase.google.com/ and click "Add project" on the homepage.
5. Then you will go through the creation of your project, just follow the guide there.
6. After you have created your project, navigate to "Project settings" found at the top left, next to the "Project overview" button.
7. Find the service accounts tab and choose python, and click the "Generate new private key" button.
8. Save the private key as "myKey.json" and place it in the same folder you extraced the downloaded ZIP file contents.
9. Run the program and download all the dependant libraries using "pip install examplelibrary".
10. After all the libraries has been installed, you should be ready to go.
